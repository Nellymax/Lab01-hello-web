I was enable to complete tasks such as installing the Node LTS, the Git and also Github desktop as well as install suitable extensions in VS code like GitLens, Prettier among others.
I was enable to configure the Git user successful using the Git Bash and also further created files like gitignore,README.md and Index.html in Vs Code where i did my assigned projects.
Using the Vs Code extension tool which is live server, i was enable to automatically open the index.html file on my default web browser that is firefox by clicking the Go live button which started a local server.
