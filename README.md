I was enable to configure the Git user successful using the Git Bash and also further created files like gitignore,README.md and Index.html in Vs Code where i did my assigned projects.
Using the Vs Code extension tool which is live server, i was enable to automatically open the index.html file on my default web browser that is firefox by clicking the Go live button which started a local server.

I obseved 200 OK status code and it means that the request was successful and the server has returned the requested data.
